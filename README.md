Project Summary: Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning

This project builds a machine learning classification model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. It demonstrates how data-driven models can identify rare but critical fraud cases in financial datasets. This project is part of my daily machine learning practice uploads on GitHub.

📌 Objective

To accurately classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate, helping reduce financial losses and improve transaction security.

📊 Dataset

Dataset used: credit_card_fraud.csv (or similar)

Contains transaction-level numerical features

Highly imbalanced dataset (fraud cases are very rare)

Target variable:

Class (0 = Legitimate, 1 = Fraud)

🛠️ Steps Performed

Loaded and explored the dataset

Analyzed class imbalance

Performed data preprocessing and scaling

Trained a classification model for fraud detection

Evaluated model performance using:

Confusion Matrix

Accuracy

Precision, Recall, and F1-score

Focused on minimizing False Negatives (missed fraud cases)

📈 Key Insight

Fraud detection requires more than just accuracy due to class imbalance.

Recall and Precision are more important metrics than accuracy alone.

The model successfully identifies suspicious transactions while controlling false alarms.

🧪 Outputs

Fraud vs non-fraud predictions

Confusion matrix visualization

Classification performance metrics

🚀 Conclusion

This project demonstrates a real-world application of machine learning in financial risk management. Detecting fraudulent transactions is a critical use case where machine learning can significantly enhance security and trust.
